                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a PhD scholar at Melborune Law School who took a shot at GitHub to make a personal website during an unofficial break because why not! My research explores the intersections of privacy, political theory and new technologies. It critically examines how emerging digital systems shape and challenge fundamental rights, with a particular focus on privacy and its implications for marginalized communities. Through an interdisciplinary approach, I engage with legal, technological, and political frameworks to advocate for more equitable and just digital futures. </p>
