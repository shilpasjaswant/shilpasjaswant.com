                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a PhD scholar at Melborune Law School who took a shot at GitHub to make a personal website during an unofficial break because why not! My research explores the intersections of privacy, political theory and new technologies. It critically examines how emerging digital systems shape and challenge fundamental rights, with a particular focus on privacy and its implications for marginalized communities. Through an interdisciplinary approach, I engage with legal, technological, and political frameworks to advocate for more equitable and just digital futures. I previously worked as a Competition lawyer in India and Germany. While working on different matters on competition law and digital platforms, I grew interested in data protection and ways in regulating digital pltforms besides the existing corporate laws. This also made me to shift my focus from practice to academia and I have since enjoyed being an academic.  </p>
